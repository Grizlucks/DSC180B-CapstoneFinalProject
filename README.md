# DSC180B-CapstoneFinalProject

Evaluating gender bias within images generated by DallE-2.

Requirements:

This project makes use of OPENAI and requires a 'config.py' file
with the below line. 

- OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

If running the test target with an OpenAI key, it will generate ten images
(256x256) on that account to be charged (or with the user's remaining free
credits if any.)

## Instructions and Project Guide

### run.py

Call 'python run.py test' to run the project using test data. This requires
a valid OpenAI API Key. See the above section for more information. 

## notebooks/

Included for reference, these notebooks were used in the hand-labeling 
process. 

## src/ 

Contains all source code in generating images and selecting occupations
within a specified range (of a 50/50 gender split). Currently, only tester
images can be generated.
